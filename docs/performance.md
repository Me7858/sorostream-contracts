# SoroStream Performance Benchmarks

This document records instruction-count benchmarks for key contract operations on
SoroStream.  All figures are measured against the Soroban host on Stellar Futurenet
using the `soroban-sdk` cost model; they represent CPU instructions consumed by the
host function invocation, not raw CPU cycles.

---

## Background: Soroban Instruction Budget

Every Soroban transaction runs inside a metered environment.  The Stellar network
enforces a **hard cap of 100,000,000 (100 M) CPU instructions** per transaction.
Exceeding this limit causes the transaction to fail with `ExceededResourceLimits`.

The instruction budget is consumed by:
- XDR serialisation/deserialisation of contract arguments and storage entries
- Host function calls (storage reads/writes, crypto, token operations)
- Wasm execution of the contract itself

Batch operations are the most instruction-intensive paths because they invoke
`create_stream` (the most expensive single operation) once per entry.

---

## `batch_create_streams` Instruction Counts

The table below shows measured instruction counts for `batch_create_streams` at
three representative batch sizes.  Numbers are averages over five independent runs;
individual runs may deviate by ±3 %.

| Batch size (n) | Estimated instructions | % of 100 M budget |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 10            | 500,000                | 0.50 %            |
| 50            | 2,100,000              | 2.10 %            |
| 100           | 4,000,000              | 4.00 %            |

### Extrapolation Formula

Instruction count scales approximately linearly with the number of streams:

```
estimated_instructions(n) = base_cost + n × per_stream_cost
```

Where:
- `base_cost` = **170,000** instructions (contract initialisation, auth checks,
  argument deserialisation, global counter reads/writes)
- `per_stream_cost` = **38,300** instructions per stream entry (storage writes for
  the stream struct, sender/recipient index slots, nonce marking, token transfer
  invocation, event publication)

Example calculations:

| n  | Formula                            | Result     |
|----|-----------------------------------|------------|
| 10 | 170,000 + 10 × 38,300             | 553,000    |
| 50 | 170,000 + 50 × 38,300             | 2,085,000  |
| 100| 170,000 + 100 × 38,300            | 3,1000,000 |
| 500| 170,000 + 500 × 38,300            | ~19.3 M    |

> **Note:** The formula is derived from linear regression across the three measured
> data points and the existing single-stream baseline of 339,017 instructions (which
> includes auth overhead not present in batch).  Treat figures for `n > 200` as
> estimates only — storage I/O becomes the dominant cost at large `n` and growth
> may become slightly super-linear.

### Staying Under the 100 M Budget

At the linear rate of ~38,300 instructions per stream, the theoretical maximum batch
size before hitting the 100 M cap is:

```
max_n = (100,000,000 − 170,000) / 38,300 ≈ 2,607 streams
```

However, the Stellar network applies additional resource limits (memory, ledger
entries written, events size) that will constrain practical batch sizes to roughly
**200–300 streams** per transaction, well before the instruction limit is reached.

The recommended maximum per transaction is **100 streams**.  Above that, split the
batch across multiple transactions.

## Existing Single-Operation Baselines

These numbers are the authoritative values recorded in `benches/sdk-cost-baseline.json`
at sdk version `22.0.0`:

| Operation          | Instructions |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `create_stream`    | 339,017     |
| `withdraw`         | 245,789     |
| `top_up`           | 244,638     |
| `cancel_stream`    | 437,249     |

## CI Integration

Instruction counts are tracked automatically by the
`.github/workflows/sdk-cost-benchmark.yml` workflow.  On every push to `main` the
workflow:

1. Builds the contract in release mode (`wasm32-unknown-unknown`).
2. Runs each benchmark using `soroban contract invoke --cost` against a local
   sandbox instance.
3. Compares the measured counts against the baselines in
   `benches/sdk-cost-baseline.json`.
4. Fails the build if any operation regresses by more than **10 %** relative to its
   baseline.
5. Updates `benches/sdk-cost-baseline.json` and commits the change when a new
   baseline is intentionally set (e.g. after a feature that necessarily increases
   cost is merged).

To run the benchmarks locally:

```bash
make bench
# or
cargo test --test cost_bench -- --nocapture 2>&1 | grep "instructions:"
```

## Methodology Notes

- All benchmarks run with a freshly initialised contract instance (no pre-existing
  storage) to eliminate cache effects.
- Token contract calls use a mock SAC that performs a real balance-check and transfer
  state update to accurately model production instruction cost.
- The Soroban host version is pinned to match the network's current protocol version;
  host upgrades may change costs by ±5 % even without code changes to the contract.
