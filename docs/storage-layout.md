# Storage Footprint Benchmarks

This document records the number of ledger storage entries each contract instruction reads and writes. These numbers are measured by the test suite in `contracts/stream/src/storage_bench.rs` and tracked against the committed baseline in `benches/storage_baseline.json`.

## Baseline Results

| Instruction               | Read Entries | Write Entries |
|---------------------------|:------------:|:-------------:|
| `create_stream`           | 3            | 10            |
| `withdraw`                | 4            | 4             |
| `top_up`                  | 3            | 4             |
| `cancel_stream`           | 4            | 5             |
| `partial_cancel_stream`   | 3            | 11            |
| `batch_create_stream` (N=5) | 3          | 25            |
| `batch_withdraw` (N=5)    | 4            | 8             |
| `get_stream`              | 2            | 0             |
| `get_claimable`           | 2            | 0             |

### Soroban Protocol 22 Per-Transaction Limits

| Resource             | Limit |
|----------------------|-------|
| Read ledger entries  | 40    |
| Write ledger entries | 25    |

## What Each Instruction Touches

### `create_stream` (3 reads, 10 writes)

**Reads:** instance (`next_id`, `paused`) + persistent (`nonce`).

**Writes:** instance (`next_id`) + persistent (`stream`, `nonce`, sender slot, sender count, recipient slot, recipient count) + token balance entries.

### `withdraw` (4 reads, 4 writes)

**Reads:** persistent (`stream`) + token balance entries.

**Writes:** persistent (`stream`) + token balance entries.

### `top_up` (3 reads, 4 writes)

**Reads:** persistent (`stream`) + token balance entries.

**Writes:** persistent (`stream`) + token balance entries.

### `cancel_stream` (4 reads, 5 writes)

**Reads:** persistent (`stream`) + token balance entries.

**Writes:** persistent (`stream`) + token balance entries (refund to sender + payment to recipient).

### `partial_cancel_stream` (3 reads, 11 writes)

**Reads:** persistent (`stream`, sender count, recipient count).

**Writes:** persistent (old `stream`, new `stream`, sender slot, sender count, recipient slot, recipient count) + token balance entries.

### `batch_create_stream` N=5 (3 reads, 25 writes)

**Reads:** instance (`next_id`) + persistent (sender count, recipient count shared across iterations).

**Writes:** instance (`next_id`) + N x (stream, sender slot, sender count, recipient slot, recipient count). Write entries scale as ~5N + 1. At N=5 this hits the 25-entry write limit exactly.

### `batch_withdraw` N=5 (4 reads, 8 writes)

**Reads:** N x (stream + token balance).

**Writes:** N x (stream + token balance). Write entries scale as ~3N.

### `get_stream` / `get_claimable` (2 reads, 0 writes)

Read-only queries. Read the instance storage (for contract metadata) plus one persistent stream entry.

## CI Regression Check

The CI workflow runs `check_storage_baseline_regression` which:

1. Exercises each instruction and measures `read_entries` / `write_entries`.
2. Compares against `benches/storage_baseline.json`.
3. **Fails** if any instruction exceeds its baseline by more than **10 entries** (read or write).

### Updating the Baseline

When a change intentionally increases storage access (e.g., adding a new index):

```bash
cargo test --package sorostream-stream -- storage_bench::generate_storage_baseline --nocapture
```

Review the updated `benches/storage_baseline.json` and commit it with the change.

## Storage key reference

### Instance storage (global, survives upgrades)

These keys are fixed-cardinality contract configuration. They live in instance storage, which is tied to the contract instance and preserved across WASM upgrades.

| Key literal | Type | Value type | Description |
|-------------|------|------------|-------------|
| `Symbol("admin")` | `Symbol` | `Address` | Contract administrator |
| `Symbol("paused")` | `Symbol` | `bool` | Emergency pause flag |
| `Symbol("next_id")` | `Symbol` | `u64` | Next stream ID counter (monotonically increasing) |
| `Symbol("fee_bps")` | `Symbol` | `u32` | Protocol fee in basis points (0–10000) |
| `Symbol("treasury")` | `Symbol` | `Address` | Fee recipient address |

### Persistent storage (per-stream and per-address)

These keys store stream records, per-address indexes, and idempotency guards. They must all share the same durability to avoid silent inconsistency (see ADR-0003).

| Key encoding | Key type | Value type | Description |
|-------------|----------|------------|-------------|
| `stream_id` | `u64` | `Stream` struct | Full stream record |
| `(Symbol("sc"), address)` | `(Symbol, Address)` | `u32` | Sender stream count |
| `(Symbol("s"), address, idx)` | `(Symbol, Address, u32)` | `u64` | Sender index slot: stream ID at position `idx` |
| `(Symbol("rc"), address)` | `(Symbol, Address)` | `u32` | Recipient stream count |
| `(Symbol("r"), address, idx)` | `(Symbol, Address, u32)` | `u64` | Recipient index slot: stream ID at position `idx` |
| `(Symbol("n"), address, nonce)` | `(Symbol, Address, u64)` | `bool` | Nonce guard (idempotency) |

### Temporary storage

**Not used.** Do not reintroduce for any data that clients rely on after the creating transaction completes. See the [storage durability decision](adr/0003-storage-layout.md) and [STORAGE.md](STORAGE.md) for the rationale.

## Storage size estimation

### Per-stream cost

Each stream creation writes the following persistent entries:

| Entry | Key size (bytes) | Value size (bytes) | Count |
|-------|----------------:|-------------------:|------:|
| Stream record | 8 (u64) | ~180 (3 Addresses + 2 i128 + 4 u64 + enum + bool) | 1 |
| Sender count | ~40 (Symbol + Address) | 4 (u32) | 1 |
| Sender slot | ~44 (Symbol + Address + u32) | 8 (u64) | 1 |
| Recipient count | ~40 (Symbol + Address) | 4 (u32) | 1 |
| Recipient slot | ~44 (Symbol + Address + u32) | 8 (u64) | 1 |
| Nonce guard | ~44 (Symbol + Address + u64) | 1 (bool) | 1 |

**Estimated total per stream: ~425 bytes** across 6 persistent entries.

### Formula

For a contract with **S** unique senders, **R** unique recipients, and **N** total streams:

```
Instance storage:  ~5 entries, ~150 bytes total (fixed)
Persistent entries: N (streams) + 2S (sender counts+slots) + 2R (recipient counts+slots) + N (nonces)
                  = 2N + 2S + 2R entries

If every stream has a unique sender and recipient (worst case):
  Total persistent entries = 2N + 2N + 2N = 6N
  Total persistent bytes   ≈ 425 × N
```

### Ledger entry limits

Soroban Protocol 22 limits per transaction:

| Resource | Limit |
|----------|------:|
| Read ledger entries | 40 |
| Write ledger entries | 25 |

Key operations and their entry counts:

| Operation | Read entries | Write entries |
|-----------|------------:|-------------:|
| `create_stream` | ~4 | 6 |
| `withdraw` | ~3 | 1–2 |
| `cancel_stream` | ~3 | 1 |
| `get_streams_by_sender(N)` | 1 + N + N | 0 |
| `batch_create_stream(N)` | ~3 | 1 + 5N |

The safe maximum for `get_streams_by_sender`/`get_streams_by_recipient` pagination is **~18 streams** per page (1 counter read + 18 slot reads + 18 stream reads = 37 entries).

The safe maximum for `batch_create_stream` is **4 streams** per call (1 + 5×4 = 21 write entries).

---

## Cleanup on stream completion

When a non-auto-renew stream reaches its end time and the recipient calls `withdraw`:

| What happens | Storage effect |
|-------------|----------------|
| Stream record is **deleted** | `remove_stream(env, stream_id)` removes the `u64 → Stream` persistent entry |
| Sender/recipient index slots are **NOT deleted** | The slot entries `("s", addr, idx)` and `("r", addr, idx)` remain. Reads filter stale entries at query time by checking if `load_stream` returns `Some`. |
| Nonce guard is **NOT deleted** | `("n", sender, nonce) → true` persists to prevent stream ID reuse. |
| ID counter is **NOT decremented** | `"next_id"` only increments. Deleted stream IDs leave gaps. |

When a stream is **cancelled** (full or partial):

| What happens | Storage effect |
|-------------|----------------|
| Stream status set to `Cancelled` | The stream record remains in storage with `status: Cancelled`. It is **not** deleted. |
| For partial cancel: new stream created | A new stream record, index slots, and events are written. |

**Auto-renew streams** are never deleted — they reset their time window and remain in storage.

---

## Upgrade safety — keys that must not be reused

After a WASM upgrade via `upgrade()`, all instance and persistent storage entries are preserved with their original keys. New contract versions **must not** reuse or reinterpret existing key patterns:

| Key pattern | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| Bare `u64` keys | Reserved for `Stream` records. A new feature must not store non-Stream data under bare integer keys. |
| `Symbol("admin")`, `Symbol("paused")`, `Symbol("next_id")`, `Symbol("fee_bps")`, `Symbol("treasury")` | Reserved instance config keys. Changing their value type would corrupt contract state. |
| `("sc", addr)`, `("s", addr, idx)` | Sender index keys. Changing the value type or semantics would break `get_streams_by_sender`. |
| `("rc", addr)`, `("r", addr, idx)` | Recipient index keys. Same constraint. |
| `("n", addr, nonce)` | Nonce guards. Removing or resetting these would allow duplicate stream creation. |

When adding new storage keys in an upgrade:

1. Use a **unique Symbol prefix** that does not collide with `"s"`, `"r"`, `"sc"`, `"rc"`, `"n"`, or any instance key name.
2. Document the new key in this file before merging.
3. Consider whether existing persistent entries need migration — Soroban does not run migration scripts automatically.
